<h2>Apollo</h2>

<p>While Apollo is but a myth, his presence as a queer figure of great influence is
notable. He was involved romantically and sexually with a large number of men, and
thus is considered a patron of homosexual unions, often being worshipped
for the sake of blessing such relationships. One notable gay relationship
Apollo was involved in was with Admetus of Pherae, a noble left in charge
of his punishment after he killed Delphyne. There are variations to this myth,
with some claiming that Apollo abandoned his godly pride for the sake of this
lover of his, choosing to live as his servant in the mortal plane. However,
regardless of the version being referenced, Apollo and Admetus fostered
a wholesome and loving relationship, starkly contrasting an abundance of
romantic involvements within Greek Mythology. Admetus later grew to set his
sights on a woman named Alcestis, so Apollo, out of love, helped him
pursue her. Afterwards, when Admetus accidentally snubbed Artemis, she sent
snakes after him, and Apollo returned to save his ex-lover from demise.</p><a href=/Apollo>Go to  Apollo's page</br></a><br>

<p>There is  a large amount of debate over the nature of Achilles' relationship
with Patroclus, a fellow man: some consider it to be platonic, while others deem it
romantic: that said, not only is the gay interpretation of it absolutely valid,
it is based in cultural depictions. Ancient Greek literature portrays them as
lovers, even in works by famous authors such as Plato. In the Iliad, the
tale from which both men originated, Homer (the author) leaves the nature of their
relationship ambiguous--nonetheless, they have become a key component of LGBTQ+
history. Achilles treats Patroclus gently in the Iliad, starkly contrasting
his demeanor towards nearly everyone else in the poem. Many modern works,
including <i>The Song of Achilles,</i> are based on the gay undertones
of such a dynamic.</p>

<p>An Empress/Emperor with a complicated history, they are reported to have
  been romantically involved with women and men alike, though the degree to which
  is frequently debatable--much of what we know about them is derived from the
  writings of Cassius Dio, a historian with a likely bias against them.
  One of the men Dio reports Elagabalus to have dated, a former slave known as
  Hierocles, is generally regarded as one of the primary reasons for
  opposition to the throne. Elagabalus liked it when he (Hierocles) called
  them his queen, mistress, and wife, and once they corrected someone for referring
  to them as a lord instead of a lady. In fact, they are (supposedly) one of the
  first people to ever ask for sex reassignment via surgery--some sources even
  suggest that they offered half of the entire empire to any who could provide
  them with a vagina. Of course, all of this is possibly exaggerated by Dio, since
  he is the primary source of information about Elagabalus' personal life--but that
  is only a possibility, and applies to a significant amount of ancient history.</p>
